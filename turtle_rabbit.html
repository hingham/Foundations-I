<!-- constructor object is important /*
Style of programming using objects is very important 
Why do objects matter?
  -Procedural
    computer follow a sequence of steps - machine operates with "state"
  -Functional
    computer evaluating function on input of data
    only allowed to write functions
    ideally stateless
  -Object Oriented

  Lessen semantic gap
    lesson distance between meaning of code and semantic understanding
    Goals: greater claity, easier maintence
